The Jupyter notebook was created using the London bike sharing dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset?datasetId=376751&sortBy=voteCount).

In this project, I carried out some EDA (exploratory data analysis), data cleaning (outliers etc.) and also aimed to answer some questions via hypothesis testing. For example:

- Is bike sharing affected by weather?
- Is bike sharing affected by seasonal changes?
- Do bike sharing patterns differ from holidays / non-holidays?
